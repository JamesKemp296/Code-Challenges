// While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to
// create a function to check if the user is still alive
// called checkAlive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors
// while creating the function.

// checkAlive should return true if the player's health is
// greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

// The function receives one parameter health which will always
// be a whole number between -10 and 10.

const checkAlive = (health) => health > 0
